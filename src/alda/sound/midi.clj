  "It takes a second for a MIDI synth/sequencer instance to initialize. This is fine for
   worker processes because each worker only needs to do it once, when the
   process starts. Multiple scores can be played simultaneously by using
   multiple worker processes.

   When we only have a single process and we need multiple MIDI synth/sequencer
   instances and we need to start them on demand, to avoid hiccups and make
   playback more immediate, we can maintain a handful of pre-initialized MIDI
   synths, ready for immediate use.")
